# Chat Engine Tax Filing Service - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A conversational AI-powered chat engine service that transforms traditional rigid tax filing workflows into an intuitive, chat-based experience. The service provides seamless integration capabilities for third-party applications while handling complex tax data processing and automation through natural language interactions.

The engine addresses the complexity and user friction in traditional tax filing systems by leveraging AI to guide users through personalized conversations, automatically extracting and processing tax information, and managing multiple concurrent filing sessions with real-time performance optimization.

Target market: Tax preparation software companies, financial institutions, and accounting firms seeking to modernize their tax filing experience and improve user engagement through conversational interfaces.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our chat engine service consists of the following main API endpoints and modules:

1. **Session Management API**: Session creation, session state management, concurrent session handling
2. **Conversation Engine**: Natural language processing, tax-specific conversation flows, context management
3. **Tax Filing Processor**: Document analysis, form generation, validation and submission workflows
4. **Real-time Communication**: Server-sent events streaming, status updates, progress notifications
5. **Job Management System**: Parallel processing, queue management, job status tracking
6. **Integration API**: Webhook support, data export, external system connectivity

| Integration API | Data Export | Export tax filing data in various formats (JSON, PDF, XML) for external system integration |
| Integration API | External System Connectivity | Provide RESTful APIs for seamless integration with existing tax software and platforms |

## 3. Core Process

### API Client Flow
1. Client authenticates using API key and creates a new tax filing session
2. Client initiates conversation by sending user message to the chat endpoint
3. Engine processes message using AI, maintains context, and responds with guidance or questions
4. Client receives real-time updates via SSE connection for processing status
5. User continues conversation, uploading documents and providing information as guided
6. Engine analyzes documents, extracts data, and populates tax forms automatically
7. Client receives completed forms and validation results
8. Client can submit forms or export data for external processing

### System Admin Flow
1. Admin monitors active sessions and system performance through admin endpoints
2. Admin can view job queues, processing statistics, and error logs
3. Admin manages system configuration and API client permissions
4. Admin receives alerts for system issues or failed processing jobs

## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Design Style

Since this is a backend service with no frontend, the design considerations focus on API response structure and data presentation:

- **Response Format**: Clean JSON structure with consistent field naming and hierarchical organization
- **Status Codes**: Standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages and success indicators
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with clear error descriptions and suggested corrections
- **Documentation Style**: OpenAPI/Swagger specification with interactive documentation and code examples
- **Logging Format**: Structured JSON logs with timestamp, session ID, and detailed context information

### 4.2 API Design Overview

| API Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Response Format |
|--------------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| /api/sessions | POST | Create new session | JSON with session ID, configuration, and initial state |
| /api/sessions/{id}/chat | POST | Send message to conversation | JSON with AI response, context updates, and next steps |
| /api/sessions/{id}/upload | POST | Upload tax documents | JSON with analysis results and extracted data |
| /api/sessions/{id}/forms | GET | Retrieve generated forms | JSON with form data and completion status |
| /api/sessions/{id}/events | GET | SSE endpoint for real-time updates | Server-sent events stream with status and progress |
| /api/jobs/{id}/status | GET | Check job processing status | JSON with job state, progress percentage, and estimated completion |

### 4.3 Integration Considerations

The service is designed as a headless backend with comprehensive API documentation, SDK support for popular programming languages, and webhook capabilities for real-time integration. All endpoints support CORS for web-based integrations and provide detailed error handling for robust client implementation.
